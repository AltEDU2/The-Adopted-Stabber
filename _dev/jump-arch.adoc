=== The Jump-Arch
============
The Jump-Arch expression isn't tested yet, but will be soon!

asciimath:[P = Player]

asciimath:[P.Pos.Z += 1]

asciimath:[P.Vel.X = (P.AimVec.X * 550) +   0]

asciimath:[P.Vel.Y = (P.AimVec.Y * 550) +   0]

asciimath:[P.Vel.Z = (P.AimVec.Z * 550) + 200]

The idea behind it is that since the player weighs `blah` and also calculates a propar `"arch"`! But again, it's only a theory! We will get further as we go along, but this is all we've got!
