== The Adopted Stabber
============
Hello there! This is a W.I.P...!
We're basically recreating the concept of The Hidden: Source but a bit differently...
Recreating it will be fun! The mechanics aren't hard to get down pat!

It will be like the original, on the Source Engine, but reduxed and refined to be newer with a differences such as game play mechanics, audio-cues, etc!
